# LI.FI solana programs
LI.FI's Solana programs, organized similar to the [solana-program-examples](https://github.com/solana-developers/program-examples/tree/main/basics/repository-layout) layout recommendations.
Each program has a `program` folder containing the program's source code 
and a `ts` folder containing the TypeScript bindings for the program.

# Programs
For now, LI.FI only uses one program on Solana:
## [lifi-solana-program-1](./lifi-solana-program-1/README.md)
This program is used by LI.FI primarily to track on-chain transactions generated using the LI.FI backend/API.
