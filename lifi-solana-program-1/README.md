# lifi-solana-program-1
This program is used by LI.FI primarily to track on-chain transactions generated using the LI.FI backend/API.
It supports the following instructions:

### `TrackV1` - Track a transaction on-chain
Source Code: [src/instructions/track_v1.rs](./program/src/instructions/track_v1.rs)
- Inputs: 
    - Accounts:
      1. `sysvar_clock_account` - The clock sysvar account on Solana.
      2. `instruction_track_account` - The program derived account (PDA) corresponding to the current or previous epoch.
        (used to bundle transactions by epoch to facilitate tracking)
    - Data:
      1. `transaction_id` : Uint8Array (8 bytes) - The unique identifier used to track the transaction,
         generated by the LI.FI backend/API.
- Logic:
  1. Check account inputs for validity
     1. Check if the first account's public key is readonly and matches the clock sysvar account
     2. Check if the second account's public key is readonly and matches the PDA of either the current or previous epoch
  2. Hex-encode the `transaction_id` into a string and log it to stdout, using `solana_program::log::sol_log`, 
     in the format "LI.FI TX: 0xabcd1234"
